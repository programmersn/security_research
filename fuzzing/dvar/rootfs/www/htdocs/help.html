<h1>The ARM Exploit Laboratory</h1>
<h2>ARM STACK OVERFLOW WARM-UP EXERCISE</h2>
<p>
This is a warm-up exercise for exploiting stack overflows. The underlying web server is vulnerable to a stack overflow. Your task is to identify the input that triggers this vulnerability and write a working exploit for it.
</p>
<p>
Follow the methodology, and get a shell!
<ul>
<li>Identify the vulnerable HTTP request.
<li>Analyze the crash.
<li>Is it a stack overflow? Check registers, stack memory.
<li>Determine the offset to the Program Counter (PC).
<li>Determine the position of the stack pointer relative to the beginning of the payload.
<li>Overwrite PC precisely.
<li>Plan the payload. Where shall you place the shellcode?
<li>Search for a suitable Jump-through-Register instruction in the binary or shared libraries.
<li>Inject and return to "test shellcode" (BKPT).
<li>Prepare a final working exploit.
</ul>
