The ARM Exploit Laboratory by Saumil Shah
-----------------------------------------

Welcome to DVAR - Damn Vulnerable ARM Router.

DVAR is a warm up exercise on ARM Stack Overflows. Your goal is to trigger
the remote stack overflow on the web server running on this image, debug it
and write an exploit to achieve remote code execution.

Have fun exploiting DVAR!
